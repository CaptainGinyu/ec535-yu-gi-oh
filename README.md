# Yu-Gi-Oh  

Yu-Gi-Oh is a famous card game and anime show invented in Japan and is now popular all around the world. Our project is to design and program a Yu-Gi-Oh game on a on Gumstix Verdex Pro board. In this project, the Gumstix Verdex Pro board is used as the main process platform, and an LCD screen is used to show the user interface made with Qt. In order to make this game more engaging, an RFID reader connected with an Arduino Micro is used to read the cards. Some buttons are used to control the game instead of using keyboard input. In the end of the project, the game logic is able to handle one monster card for each side, and a Qt program is developed to make the game table for both players head-to-head. Also, a kernel module is implemented to help read from the button and push the game forward.
